This is the source code for my portfolio [https://petewatters.ie/](https://petewatters.ie/)

## Code
The app is a PWA designed to be as simple as possible. The UI is built using semantic HTML tags and CSS and some React to organise everything

## Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>

### Deployment
This app is hosted on Google Firebase. It will deploy the `build` folder if you run `firebase deploy`. You will need to configure your own project there
